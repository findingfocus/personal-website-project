    <h1>Personal Website Project: Milestone 1</h1>
    <h2><u>Purpose</u></h2>
        <p>This website will host my programming portfolio with playable demos of my interactive coding projects. It will link to my <a href="https://github.com/findingfocus">github</a> account where visitors can view my source code and also download the full version of my latest releases to play on their own computer.</a></p>
    <h2><u>Audience</u></h2>
        <p>This portfolio is developed with an emphasis on mobile optimization, and is targeted to professionals seeking responsive and impressive websites that showcase different programming skills. The target audience includes tech recruiters, hiring managers, and anyone interested in experiencing unique and interactive art.</p>
    <h2><u>Goal</u></h2>
        <p>I hope to catch the attention of people in the tech world by inviting them to interact with the games on my website. The demos will link to the full project's source code and instructions to play the full version. The main goal of this project is for visitors to easily view my <a href="https://github.com/findingfocus">github</a> portfolio and to display my contact information for potential employment opportunities. The secondary goal of this project is to add what I create onto to my already established development <a href="https://findingfocus.dev">website</a>.</p>
    <h2><u>Persona</u></h2>
        <p>Name: Jennifer Millard</p>
        <p>Profession: Technology recruiter for Sandia National Laboratories. Jennifer is looking to hire new talent with an emphasis on bolstering Sandia's goal of developing software for a strong digital engineering ecosystem. She is keeping an eye out for emerging software for next-generation platforms and potential recruits that are skilled and motivated to create new and interesting things.</p>
        <p>Technology: Casual user of the Google Pixel 3 Phone with unlimited data plan, and a quad-core Lenovo laptop running Windows 10.</p>
        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Jennifer often receives resumes that lack professional portfolios. Jennifer is eager to find passionate developers who also prioritize working with a team. The job she is recruiting for requires a high level of competency in programming. Jennifer is interested in seeing finished projects along with their source code.</p>
        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Inundated with resumes, Jennifer has grown tired of seeing plain portfolios so often. She can tell in the first 15 seconds if she's interested in the potential recruit's website. If the site is not mobile responsive she will instantly move on to another candidate. The open position at Sandia requires a government clearance, and she is screening candidates for their professionalism and reputation amongst peers.</p>
        <p>Goals: Jennifer is looking for a creative and hardworking programmer to hire for an open position at Sandia National Labs. Jennifer is trying to determine if the candidate has sufficient programming experience, and if that person might be a good cultural fit for Sandia National Laboratories. Jennifer is on the lookout for LinkedIn profiles because that can help her determine a candidate's accomplishments, interests, and education history.</p>
        <p>User Story: As a recruiter, I need to find a skilled creative programmer who can bring new projects to life and learn emerging technologies.</p>

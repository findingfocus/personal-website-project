    Purpose: What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.
    Audience: Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?
    Goal: This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:
        To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
        To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
        To attract freelance clients.
        To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
        To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).

Persona

In your milestone-1.html file, define one persona that represents the primary target audience for your Personal Website. More information on how to create a persona for your project here: http://www.webcredible.com/blog-reports/web-usability/personas.shtml

Your persona should feature the following at minimum:

    Name
    A detailed description that includes information such as: role, relevant technology being used, behaviors and attitudes, and the situation or scenario in which they will use your site.
    Frustrations your persona may be facing.
    Goal(s) regarding the use of your site.
    Additional information your persona may need in order to achieve their goal.

Summary

All written documentation should be created in valid, correct HTML markup inside the milestone-1.html file.

If requirements have not been met by the due date, or if your instructors request that additional work on this milestone be completed, a meeting will be scheduled prior to beginning work on Milestone 2.

    Purpose: What would you like your PWP to help you accomplish? This is a high-level goal akin to a Mission Statement.
    Audience: Who will be using or viewing your site? Who is this site designed for, and who is your audience comprised of? Could it be for your professional peers and other developers, potential employers, customers, or clients, etc.?
    Goal: This is should be a quantifiable goal if possible. For example, a goal for your PWP could be:
        To acquire full or part-time employment or an internship.
        To increase sales and/or conversion rates for an existing business.
        To attract freelance clients.
        To serve as a gallery to showcase and promote your work.
        To increase the reach of a new or established social media presence (as measured via analytics tools).

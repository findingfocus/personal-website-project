    <h1>Personal Website Project: Milestone 1</h1>
    <h2><u>Purpose</u></h2>
        <p>This website will be home to my professional portfolio with playable demos showing off some of my interactive coding projects.</p>
    <h2><u>Audience</u></h2>
        <p>This portfolio is developed with an emphasis on mobile optimization, and is targeted to professionals seeking responsive and impressive websites that showcase programming skills. The Target audience includes tech recruiters, hiring managers, and anyone interested in experiencing unique and interactive art.</p>
    <h2><u>Goal</u></h2>
        <p>I hope to catch the attention of people in the tech world by inviting them to interact with the games on my portfolio. The main goal of this project is for the users of this website to be able to easily view my github portfolio as well as to contact me about potential job opportunities. The secondary goal of this project is to be able to add the demo parts of it to my already established development <a href="https://findingfocus.dev">website</a>.</p>
    <h2><u>Persona</u></h2>
        <p>Name: Jennifer Millard</p>
        <p>Profession: Technology recruiter for Sandia Laboratories. Jennifer is looking to hire new talent with an emphasis on bolstering Sandia's goal of developing software for a strong digital engineering ecosystem. She is keeping an eye out for emerging software for next generation platforms and potential recruits that are skilled and motivated to create new and interesting things.</p>
        <p>Technology: Casual Google Pixel Phone user with unlimited data plan, and a quad-core Lenovo laptop running Windows 10.</p>
        <p>Attitudes and Behaviors: Jennifer often gets resume applications that lack links to professional portfolios. The job she is recruiting for requires a high level of competency with programming new things from scratch. Jennifer is interested in seeing real projects built and their source code on github.</p>
        <p>Frustrations and Needs: Inundated with resumes, Jennifer has grown tired of seeing plain portfolios so often. She can tell in the first 15 seconds if she's interested in potential recruit's websites and if the site is not mobile responsive she will instantly move on.</p>
        <p>Goals: Jennifer is looking for a creative and hardworking programmer to hire for an open position at Sandia labs.</p>
        <p>User Story: As a recruiter, I need to find a skilled creative who can bring new projects to life and learn emerging technologies.</p>

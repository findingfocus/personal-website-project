    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My personal website project will be a one page portfolio, and will contain the following sections:</p>
    <h2><u>Header:</u></h2>
    <p>The header will feature my name, skillset, and brand logo.</p>
    <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
    <p>In this section I will describe a bit about my passions and my personality, including my headshot. I will describe what languages I use, and the technologies I use to prototype interactive art ideas. I will describe that I am seeking to work with a team creating new products. I hope to convey that I am versatile in my programming skillset. I will include a sticky navbar to access any of the sections of my page from any other location.</p>

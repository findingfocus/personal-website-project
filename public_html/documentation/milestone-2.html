    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
    <p>My personal website project will be a one page portfolio, and will contain the following sections:</p>
    <h2><u>Header:</u></h2>
    <p>The header will feature my name, skillset, and brand logo.</p>
    <h2><u>About Me:</u></h2>
    <p>In this section I will describe a bit about my passions and my personality, including my headshot. I will describe what languages I use, and the technologies I use to prototype interactive art ideas. I will describe that I am seeking to work with a team creating new products. I hope to convey that I am versatile in my programming skillset. I will include a sticky navbar to access any of the sections of my page from any other location.</p>
    <h2><u>Portfolio:</u></h2>
    <p>This section will feature three playable game demos that are smaller versions of my bigger game projects already hosted on GitHub. I think interactive demos are a great way to easily share my work and catch people's attention right away. If they like the demo, they can easily view the source code on GitHub, or even download and play the full version from my GitHub releases on the repo. I want there to be a lightweight demo that users can click to play, and beneath it a dropdown box that will expand into a gif showing the fully featured game as well as a link to the source code and releases.</p>
